  "ie-flow.lifecycle — the unified agent lifecycle: kotoba + organism react-loop + Google
  co-scientist over the information-energy flow. ADR-2606211200.

  This is THE loop the user asked to design: an actor SENSES its own flow off the kotoba ledger,
  reasons like a scientist (the co-scientist tournament) about how to act on society so the flow
  keeps paying for itself AND keeps returning order (共生), pre-registers a DRY-RUN experiment
  (leak-free — the prediction is recorded BEFORE the outcome, the mitooshi discipline), scores the
  PRIOR beat's experiment against what actually happened to net-gain (Brier proper-score), learns
  a per-mechanism weight (kaizen), and persists the whole beat to a content-addressed commit-DAG.

    SENSE     fold the flow ledger → the IE-flow state (net-gain / order-index / agent-efficiency)
    ORIENT    surprise = distance from 'my flow will keep paying and keep returning order'
    HYPOTHESIZE/REVIEW/RANK/EVOLVE  the co-scientist tournament (charter-gated catalog)
    ACT       the top reviewed hypothesis → a PRE-REGISTERED dry-run施策 (outward = member-principal)
    OBSERVE   measure the prior beat's experiment against the now-observed net-gain
    LEARN     Brier proper-score → update the per-mechanism kaizen weight
    PERSIST   one content-addressed tx on the loop's own commit-DAG (idempotent, resume-safe)

  Deterministic: logical beat = loop-log length (no wall clock, no randomness). No network I/O, no
  held key (the Murakumo narrator + live persistence are injected/operator-gated). Stdlib + the
  shared kotoba.datom + ie-flow.{metrics,coscientist,ledger}."
