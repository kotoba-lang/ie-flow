  "ie-flow.ingest — REAL-WORLD data → EDN → measured → DataLad. ADR-2606211200.

  The user asked that real-world data be stored as EDN, MEASURED, into DataLad (the 80-data
  substrate, ADR-2605241500). This namespace ingests a real public flow source into the IE-flow
  ledger (content-addressed kotoba EDN under `80-data/ie-flow/<source>/`), computes the order
  metrics over it, and writes a provenance record — the same load-discipline as jinushi/genome:
  the SNAPSHOT is the source of truth, the loop re-measures the committed snapshot with zero
  network I/O.

  Source `:git` makes the monorepo MEASURE ITS OWN information-energy flow — the org as a dissipative
  structure observing its own development metabolism. Each commit is a measured flow EVENT:
    actor   = the author (an AI author → :agent? true, so agent-efficiency is measured for real)
    source  = :repo
    target  = the top-level layer that absorbed the most change (where order accreted)
    volume  = files touched      cost = deletions (entropy shed)    value = insertions (order added)
  Shelling to the `git` system binary via babashka.process is permitted (we author no logic in
  shell; ADR-2606182359 exemption). Source `:edn-events` ingests any committed EDN vector of event
  maps. :clj only (I/O tool). Deterministic for a fixed range/snapshot."
