  "ie-flow.score — the composite INFORMATION-CONTROL score + the artificial-organism reward.
  ADR-2606212200 (on the ie-flow order calculus, ADR-2606211200).

  Every actor that embeds the ie-flow lifecycle is an INFORMATION-CONTROL ACTOR in the system +
  energy flow: it RECTIFIES (整流) scattered flow into returned order. This namespace turns an
  actor's flow-state (etzhayyim.ie-flow.metrics) into ONE scalar — its active-inference 利得 — and
  folds the whole system of systems into the artificial organism's REWARD.

    info-control-score  ∈ 0..1   an actor's 利得: how well it rectifies flow into returned order,
                                 pays for itself (Φ), stays 共生 (η), is a 利得 not a paid magic-
                                 circle — minus its surprise (variational free energy), GATED by
                                 子孫 wellbecoming (G-subordinate; descendant ≤ veto → 0).
    score-roster                 the SoS scoreboard (every embedded actor scored + ranked).
    colony-reward                Σ score × √throughput → the colony 利得; :colony-order is its
                                 rounded form = a NEGENTROPY SOURCE the organism's metabolism draws
                                 on (ibuki Φ → reserves), so the organism's reward = the colony's
                                 aggregate information-control. Active inference at the colony scale.

  PURE + deterministic (no wall clock, no randomness) so a score is content-addressable and a
  scoreboard reproducible. Weights are DATA (score-weights.edn) — re-weighting the whole SoS is a
  data edit, not code. Stdlib + ie-flow.metrics only."
