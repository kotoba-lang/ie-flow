(ns etzhayyim.ie-flow.ledger
  "ie-flow.ledger — the information-energy flow as an append-only kotoba Datom log. ADR-2606211200.

  The founding design (the user's sketch) puts immutable atomic FACTS — events, nodes, edges,
  stocks, interventions, model runs — in a Datomic-style ledger, and does the CALCULATION in pure
  functions. This is exactly the etzhayyim substrate boundary: canonical state is the kotoba Datom
  log (content-addressed EAVT, append-only 非終末論, ADR-2605312345), and the metric/dynamics/
  co-scientist code is pure folds over it. So the ledger here is the org-native realisation of that
  Datomic-flow ledger: a content-addressed commit-DAG (reusing the shared `kotoba.datom`), with the
  flow ontology as data (schema.edn).

    EVENT        a measured atom of flow: actor moved energy from :source → :target at a :cost,
                 realising :value, at :risk, with :volume (the Sankey backbone)
    NODE         a station in the flow (an organism, agent, page, product, fund…)
    EDGE         an aggregated source→target channel (derived; materialised on read by metrics)
    STOCK        an accumulated order snapshot (subscribers / trust / data-asset / reserves…)
    INTERVENTION a施策 hypothesis the co-scientist pre-registers (dry-run; member-principal outward)

  Append-only (:db/add only — re-measurement is a NEW datom, never an overwrite). Deterministic:
  the caller supplies tx-id + as-of (logical time = log length), so the chain is reproducible and
  crash-resume is byte-identical. No network I/O, no held key (no-server-key)."
