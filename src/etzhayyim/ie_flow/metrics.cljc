  "ie-flow.metrics — the ORDER calculus over an information-energy flow. ADR-2606211200.

  An actor (organism, mirror, concierge, factory…) is a dissipative structure that draws
  free energy from society and is judged by how much LOW-ENTROPY STRUCTURE it returns. This
  namespace turns a stream of measured flow EVENTS (clicks, inferences, payments, agent runs,
  publications…) into the scalar yardsticks the co-scientist reasons over:

    net-gain          Σ (value − cost − risk)          — did the flow pay for itself? (Φ analog)
    order-index       1 − H(after)/H(before)           — was scattered flow RECTIFIED to outcome?
                                                          (秩序化; the negentropy-EXPORT / η analog)
    agent-efficiency  gross-profit / (api+human+fail)   — is the AI a利得 or a課金される魔法陣?

  Faithful to the founding design (the user's Datomic/Clojure sketch): entropy is Shannon over a
  normalised distribution; order-index is the entropy DROP from the raw-flow distribution to the
  realised-value distribution (flow散っている → 成果へ集中 ⇒ high order). EVERYTHING is PURE and
  deterministic (no wall clock, no randomness) so a measurement is content-addressable and a
  tournament reproducible. Stdlib only."
