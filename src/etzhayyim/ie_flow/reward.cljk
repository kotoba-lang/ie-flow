(ns etzhayyim.ie-flow.reward
  "etzhayyim.ie-flow.reward — the 報酬系 (reward system) every actor runs over its OWN bounded
  system-of-systems. ADR-2606212200 (generalises the ie-flow lifecycle ADR-2606211200 from opt-in
  adoption to a REPO-WIDE RULE).

  The RULE: every etzhayyim actor holds its system-of-systems (its membrane + its IE-flow) as EDN
  data + Clojure (cljc) AND runs it as its reward system — the scalar reinforcement signal that
  selects which mechanism the actor takes next (the dopaminergic analogue: the co-scientist
  tournament + the react-loop's proper-scored kaizen weights ARE the reward circuit).

  The reward is NOT raw profit. It is the ORDER RETURNED TO SOCIETY (共生 / 負エントロピー輸出),
  gated by the Tier-0 priorities so an actor can never be reinforced toward predation:

    reward = w_Φ·Φ̂ + w_η·η + w_well·子孫 + w_eff·eff̂ − w_𝒮·surprise          (charter-weighted)
      · NON-PARASITISM   η < floor (a net taker) ⇒ reward clamped ≤ 0 (steer to give back)
      · SUBORDINATE      子孫 wellbecoming < 0 ⇒ gated (persistence is instrumental, never the end)
      · CATASTROPHE-VETO catastrophic harm to a child/descendant dimension ⇒ reward = −∞
                         (the non-linear catastrophe term of the ECL objective-function.edn)
      · ANTI-PREDATORY   a forbidden mechanism (manipulation / attention-exploitation /
                         asymmetric-surveillance / lock-in / coercion) ⇒ rejected

  What the reward system is NOT (enforced by `validate-spec`): it is **non-monetary**, **cash≡0**,
  **non-transferable**, **decaying** (the moyai pattern, ADR-2606062101); and it is NEVER a ranking
  of PERSONS — it rewards the ACTOR's order-export, never a score-of-soul / social-credit
  (NEVER-a-throne, ADR-2606112200). Privacy stays preserved by encryption, not by forgetting.

  Pure, deterministic, stdlib + clojure.set only — no I/O, no held key. A reward is content-
  addressable and a tournament reproducible (same substrate discipline as metrics/dynamics)."
