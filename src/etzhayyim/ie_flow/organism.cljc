  "etzhayyim.ie-flow.organism — project the information-energy flow ledger into the /organism
  page. ADR-2606211200.

  The organism view already renders the colony's STRUCTURE (cells/vitals), live ACTIVITY (pulse),
  情緒 (joucho) and EVOLUTION (trajectory). This adds the fifth layer the IE-flow lifecycle measures:
  the *information-energy flow itself* — did the metabolism PAY FOR ITSELF (net-gain), and did it
  RECTIFY scattered free-energy into low-entropy structure returned to society (order-index /
  負エントロピー輸出)? It is a pure fold of the committed flow snapshot
  (`80-data/ie-flow/<source>/flow.kotoba.edn`) through `etzhayyim.ie-flow.{ledger,metrics}`,
  emitting `ieflow.json` into every served organism dir.

  clj/bb, deterministic (logical time = the snapshot's as-of), no network I/O, no held key — the
  same substrate discipline as vitals/pulse/joucho."
