  "ie-flow.coscientist — the Google 'AI co-scientist' lifecycle, generalised over the information-
  energy flow so EVERY actor can run it. ADR-2606211200 (generalises ibuki's ADR-2606201200).

  Generate → Reflect → Rank → Evolve → Meta-review, but the fitness is the IE-flow yardstick
  (Δnet-gain + Δorder-index, weighted by 子孫 wellbecoming, per unit cost): each beat the actor
  proposes candidate SOCIETAL INTERVENTIONS that would make its flow pay for itself AND rectify
  scattered flow into returned structure (秩序化), critiques them against the Charter, runs a
  deterministic Elo tournament, evolves the winners, and hands the top reviewed hypothesis to the
  lifecycle as a PRE-REGISTERED experiment.

  The generation is a charter-clean CATALOG, never an LLM free-write, so a predatory mechanism is
  structurally unrepresentable — the SAME aligned/forbidden vocabulary every organism shares. The
  Murakumo fleet narrates the meta-review (the actor reasons in words) but never the structured
  generation. PURE + deterministic (no wall clock, no randomness)."
