(ns etzhayyim.ie-flow.embed
  "ie-flow.embed — the system-of-systems entry point: how EVERY actor embeds the information-energy
  flow lifecycle. ADR-2606211200.

  The user asked for this loop to be built into each actor so the colony of actors is a SYSTEM OF
  SYSTEMS — each one measuring its own flow, reasoning (co-scientist) about how to keep its flow
  paying while returning order, and persisting to its own kotoba ledger. Rather than fork the loop
  into ~80 actors, the loop is ONE shared library and each actor embeds it with three lines:

    (require '[etzhayyim.ie-flow.embed :as ie])
    (ie/record! \"<actor>\" measured-events {:as-of n})   ; feed the flow ledger
    (ie/beat! \"<actor>\" {:as-of n})                       ; run one co-scientist ReAct beat

  An actor may register a per-actor intervention catalog extension (its own aligned ways of acting
  on society) in `actor-registry` — but the SAFETY vocabulary (aligned/forbidden mechanisms, the
  gates) is shared and unforkable, so the system-of-systems shares one charter-clean safety property.

  Paths default under the DataLad data root `80-data/ie-flow/<actor>/` (real-world data as EDN,
  measured, content-addressed). Deterministic, no-server-key. Stdlib + ie-flow.{ledger,lifecycle}."
