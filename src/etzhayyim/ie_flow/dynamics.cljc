  "ie-flow.dynamics — system-dynamics over the accumulated-order stocks. ADR-2606211200.

  The flow ledger captures the FLOWS (rates); the stocks accumulate ORDER (subscribers, trust,
  data-asset, model-quality, reserves…). Datomic stores the stocks; Clojure evolves them. This is
  the user's `step-system`/`simulate` generalised: a stock map + a per-step inputs map → the next
  stock map, and `simulate` is `reductions` over a sequence of inputs (counterfactual: 施策 before
  vs after). PURE — no I/O, no randomness; a run is reproducible and content-addressable, and is
  persisted to the ledger as a model-run snapshot by the caller."
