  "Information-theoretic PROPERTY validation of the ie-flow order calculus (ADR-2606211200).
  test_metrics pins point values (ln 2 for a fair coin, identity → 0); this complements it by
  validating the analytical properties the order-index actually relies on:
    - Shannon entropy is maximised by the uniform distribution, H(uniform_n) = ln n, and bounded
      0 ≤ H ≤ ln n  (the ceiling the order-index normalises against);
    - the order-index is SCALE-INVARIANT — scaling both histograms by a common factor leaves it
      unchanged (this is the whole reason it can compare flows of different total volume);
    - its SIGN tracks the direction of ordering: concentrating a scattered flow is positive
      (秩序化), scattering a concentrated one is negative (the dis-ordering branch test_metrics
      never exercises).
  A regression in the entropy base, the normalisation, or the order-index formula is caught as a
  violated invariant, not just a drifted single number."
